# IPL_Analysis-2008-2020

This project delves into the analysis of the Indian Premier League (IPL) twenty-over (T20) cricket tournament match data spanning from 2008 to 2020. The primary focus of this analysis revolves around player performance, specifically batting and bowling, as well as examining the influence of the coin toss on match outcomes.

Cricket, often hailed as "a gentleman's game," boasts a rich heritage dating back to 1709 in England. It has evolved into a beloved sport with global reach, notably during the era of the British Empire. In India, cricket has transcended borders, uniting diverse communities and identities.

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) introduced the Indian Premier League in 2007, establishing an annual professional T20 franchise. Corporate entities invested in city-based teams strategically positioned across India, vying for the coveted title of IPL champions. The tournament's international appeal allowed team owners to draft players through auctions, drawing from a pool of global cricket talent. The IPL brand has witnessed remarkable growth, its value soaring from $2 billion USD in 2009 to a staggering $5.7 billion USD in 2019.

As a Trinidadian residing in the West Indies, cricket holds a special place in my cultural identity. It has played a pivotal role in uniting the Caribbean region on the global stage, with the West Indies cricket team, comprising top talents from the region, achieving victories against renowned international teams, including those from England and Australia. West Indian and Trinidadian cricketers have showcased their skills on the IPL stage, further elevating the tournament's reputation and leading to the emergence of related competitions, such as the Caribbean Premier League.

Similar to India, cricket is a prevalent social activity in my homeland, fostering discussions and camaraderie. This inspired my exploration of IPL match data from 2008 to 2020. In this project, I aim to address key questions to provide valuable insights into past IPL tournaments.
